- 👋 Hi, I’m @P0SEID0N
- 🤗 I am an engineering leader both technical and people focused. I spend most of my time these days either in code fixing a larger technical problem, or mentoring helping another developer overcome some obstacle, and I love it!
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, providing cool things to developers to use and for gamers to use to experience their games in great and awesome ways.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on expanding my portfolio to encompass as many cool languages and processes as possible
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of community contribution project.
